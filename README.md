## How you can start up the application

The project is a server part, and is able to receive requests from clients (browsers), process them,
and return the response. Postman will also be very useful for testing the application, and see how it works. So you need:

* [download](https://github.com/dima-semeniuk/air_companies_management_system/blob/main/postman/AirCompaniesManagementSystem.postman_collection.json) 
the Postman collection from my GitHub repository and import it into your desktop Postman or web Postman Api Platform
* You can fork project to your GitHub repository or copy URL from my repo and make clone of the project locally to your machine.
Then open project in IntelliJ Idea
* The project uses a Docker and after download the application from GitHub, before running project don't forget install, 
and run Docker on your machine ðŸ’»
* Also, you will need to set up the file `.env` at the root of the project. Change the password to your value 
(also you can change other properties), like in the picture below:

* Run in console command `docker-compose build` to build Docker images defined in a docker-compose.yml file. 
After building images, run the command `docker-compose up` to start application
* Then go to Postman and use the functionalities of controllers:
